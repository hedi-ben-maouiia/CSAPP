Assuming w = 4, we can assign a numeric value to each possible hexadecimal
digit, assuming either an unsigned or a two’s-complement interpretation. Fill in
the following table according to these interpretations by writing out the nonzero
powers of 2 in the summations shown in Equations 2.1 and 2.3:


Hexadecimal Binary      B2U4(x)                     B2T4(x)

0xA         [1010]      23 + 21 = 10                −23 + 21 = −6

0x1         [0001]      2^0 = 1                     2^0 = 1 

0xB         [1011]      2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 11        -2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = -5  

0x2         [0010]      2^1 = 2                     2^1 = 2

0x7         [0111]      2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 7         2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 7
    
0xC         [1100]      2^3 + 2^2 = 12              -2^3 + 2^2 = -4
