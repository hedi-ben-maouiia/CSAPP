Show that each of the following bit vectors is a two’s-complement representation
of −4 by applying Equation 2.3:

A. [1100]
B. [11100]
C. [111100]

Observe that the second and third bit vectors can be derived from the first by sign
extension.

2^4 - 2^3 = 16 - 8 = 8 + 2 ^ 2 = 12 

2 ^ 5 - 2 ^ 4 = 32 - 16 = 16
