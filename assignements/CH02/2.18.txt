In Chapter 3, we will look at listings generated by a disassembler, a program that
converts an executable program file back to a more readable ASCII form. These
files contain many hexadecimal numbers, typically representing values in two’scomplement form. Being able to recognize these numbers and understand their
significance (for example, whether they are negative or positive) is an important
skill.
For the lines labeled A–I (on the right) in the following listing, convert the
hexadecimal values (in 32-bit two’s-complement form) shown to the right of the
instruction names (sub, mov, and add) into their decimal equivalents:



0x2e0 = 736 
-0x58 = -88 
0x28  = 40 
-0x30 = -48 
0x78  = 120
0x88  = 136 
0x1f8 = 504 

0x8   = 8 

0xc0  = 192 
-0x48 = -72
