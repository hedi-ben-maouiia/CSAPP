Consider the following three calls to show_bytes:

int a = 0x12345678;
byte_pointer ap = (byte_pointer) &a;
show_bytes(ap, 1); /* A. */
show_bytes(ap, 2); /* B. */
show_bytes(ap, 3); /* C. */

Indicate the values that will be printed by each call on a little-endian machine
and on a big-endian machine:

A. Little endian: 78                Big endian: 78

B. Little endian: 78 56             Big endian: 56 78

C. Little endian: 78 56 34          Big endian: 34 56 78
