Suppose we truncate a 4-bit value (represented by hex digits 0 through F) to a 3-
bit value (represented as hex digits 0 through 7.) Fill in the table below showing
the effect of this truncation for some cases, in terms of the unsigned and two’scomplement interpretations of those bit patterns.


    Hex                     Unsigned                      Two’s complement

1           1               1       1                      1        1

3           3               3       3                      3        3

5           5               5       5                      5        5

C           4               12      4                      −4       4

E           6               14      6                      −2       6

Explain how Equations 2.9 and 2.10 apply to these cases.
