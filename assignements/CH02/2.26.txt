You are given the assignment of writing a function that determines whether one
string is longer than another. You decide to make use of the string library function
strlen having the following declaration:



/* Prototype for library function strlen */
size_t strlen(const char *s);


Here is your first attempt at the function:

/* Determine whether string s is longer than string t */
/* WARNING: This function is buggy */

int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
    return strlen(s) - strlen(t) > 0;
}
When you test this on some sample data, things do not seem to work quite
right. You investigate further and determine that, when compiled as a 32-bit
120 Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information
program, data type size_t is defined (via typedef) in header file stdio.h to be
unsigned.

A. For what cases will this function produce an incorrect result?

in case the string t > string s the function will produce an incorrect result of s > t 

B. Explain how this incorrect result comes about.

    that because size_t is an unsigned and as and if we have for exemple an strlen(s) = 5
    and strlen(t) = 6 and when we subtract s - t and as we know that unsigned value will yeiled to UMax 
    and when we compare UMax with strlen(t) it will give as  s > t

C. Show how to fix the code so that it will work reliably.

     we simple make it 
     return strlen(s) > strlen(t);
