Assuming w = 4, we can assign a numeric value to each possible hexadecimal
digit, assuming either an unsigned or a two’s-complement interpretation. Fill in
the following table according to these interpretations by writing out the nonzero
powers of 2 in the summations shown in Equations 2.1 and 2.3:


Hexadecimal Binary      B2U4(x)            B2T4(x)

0xA         [1010]      23 + 21 = 10    −23 + 21 = −6

0x1

0xB

0x2
